# IRA Performance & Fee Calculator

![IRA Performance Calculator Banner](ira-logo.png)

## üöÄ Overview

This is a user-friendly, client-side **web application** designed to simplify tracking and analyzing **Individual Retirement Account (IRA)** investments. It automates calculations for quarterly performance metrics like balances, deposits, gains, losses, fees, and returns.

I built this tool to help my uncle move away from error-prone, time-consuming manual spreadsheets for monitoring his retirement portfolio. Now hosted on **GitHub Pages**, he uses it regularly to gain clear insights into his investments.

The app runs **entirely client-side** in the browser, ensuring **data privacy**‚Äîno information is ever sent to a server. It's built with vanilla web technologies for simplicity and ease of maintenance.

## üí° Features

- **Dynamic Input Table**: Easily add, edit, or delete quarters. Fields include quarter name, beginning balance, deposits, ending balance, and fees. It auto-calculates **net gain/loss**, **net after fees**, and **return %** for each row.
- **Balance Synchronization**: The "**Link Balances**" button automatically sets each quarter's beginning balance to the previous ending balance, with warnings for mismatches.
- **Summary Metrics**: Displays overall totals including initial/current balance, total deposits/fees/gains/losses, net after fees, and the crucial **cumulative return %**.
- **Interactive Charts** (via Chart.js):
    - Balance and Return Over Time (line chart with dual axes).
    - Net Gain/Loss per Quarter (color-coded bar chart).
    - Totals Breakdown (bar chart summarizing cumulative performance).
- **Key Insights Dashboard**: Analyzes the data to highlight best/worst quarters, average return, performance trends, profitable quarter rate, and the impact of fees in visually appealing cards.
- **User Guidance**: Includes in-app instructions, tooltips on table headers, **formula breakdowns**, chart color legends, and descriptive notes for non-technical users.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Validates inputs, prevents invalid operations (e.g., deleting the last row), and handles edge cases like zero divisions.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

## üõ£ Development Story

The project was born from a real need: simplifying IRA tracking for a non-technical family member. I prototyped a basic calculator and rapidly iterated based on his direct feedback, leading to the addition of crucial features like the insights dashboard and visualizations. Development took about **two days** part-time, with a strong focus on usability. The main challenges were ensuring chart responsiveness across devices and building robust handling for various data edge cases.

## üåü Future Enhancements

-   CSV import/export functionality for data backup.
-   Annual rollups and future projections.
-   Dark mode toggle for improved aesthetics.
-   Integration with a mock API to load sample data for demonstration.
